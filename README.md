Coding and Pull Requests Guidelines
-----------------------------------

* We follow the [Oracle coding conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html).
  * 4 spaces; not tabs.
  * No trailing whitespaces.
  * No 80 column limit.
* Pull requests should be tested before submission.
* Any additions in API should be properly documented.
* Avoid unnecessary class coupling where possible.
* Don't include IDE-specific files, class files, jar files, and whatnot; that is what the .gitignore is for!
